Project-Starter v0.0.0

Nobody should start to undertake a large project.

If you only wanted to start a module, it would be easy. But you need to start 
a project with perhaps dozens of files and I can't tell what they are. You 
probably don't start a new project every week so you'd rather not spend too 
much time learning my clever system. You know that every project is subtly 
different from every previous one, even at the level of stub files. You would 
like to take some of the drugery out of that initial commit. 
Project::Starter is here to help. 

Many templates are shipped with this distribution and you can use 
Template::Toolkit placeholders to create more, freely. You may create 
multiple profiles, each with its own config file, which may be written in any 
format accepted by Config::Any. Both config files and templates may be 
cascaded to start projects of any scale and type; with minimal effort. 
New content may be added to an existing project as easily as one is started 
from scratch.
